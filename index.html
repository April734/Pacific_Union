  <h2>Spirituality helps teens make better decisions in life.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="container">


    <div class="box-text">
      <p>Belief in a higher power and a sense of spirituality can help some teens make better decisions, especially about ethical issues. Teens are in a time of their life where they are pressured by outside forces to commit actions that are not very ethical.
      </p>
      <br>
        <p>Many teens find themselves at a crossroads, looking for guidance.  Spirituality is able to give teens a sense of guidance that can help prevent them from participating in risk-taking behavior.  Religion acts as a source of resiliency, a buffer against negative  environmental influences leading to negative consequences. Attending a church or being involved in religious programs can offer teens support in a time in their life where they need it the most.  They can provide a community of like-minded peers and older mentors that can give them guidance.
        Spirituality is able to do this because in general, it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves.

    <h2>Spirituality can help youth maintain good mental health.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="container-2">
    <div class="box-text-2">
      <p>Spirituality can help youth cope with everyday stress and can keep them grounded.
Spirituality can offer youth a sense of understanding their experiences. Religion offers explanations of why suffering exists in the world. Turning to these explanations can bring comfort to many young people confronting illness. Many youth ask “why me”? This  question can never fully be answered by medical science. Some people find the answers they seek in spirituality.
</p>
      <br>
        <p>Another aspect that can positively effect your mental health and spirituality is forgiveness. People who carry around grudges can verify; it’s hard to find positivity and inner peace when you’re harboring hateful feelings.  Even youth that have experienced severe trauma in their life can learn to apply forgiveness and move on. Unresolved conflicts can affect your mental health, setting you up for higher risks of depression and anxiety. The human body is put through a constant battle  between fight and flight when your angry all the time. Forgiveness is a choice, but a positive one when it comes to your health.</p>

      <br>
        <p>Contemplation is thoughtful observation or study. Contemplation practices are activities that guide you to direct your attention to a specific focus-often an inward-looking reflection or concentration on a specific sensation or concept. Contemplation practice can help youth be more spiritual. Prayer is a contemplation practice and it may elicit the relaxation response, along with feelings of hope, gratitude, and compassion-all of which are rooted in the belief that there is a higher power that has some influence over our life. This belief can provide a sense of comfort and support in difficult times.
